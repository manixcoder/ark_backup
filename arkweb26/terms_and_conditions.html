                    <ul>
                        <li> We reserve the right to modify or terminate the Service or your access to the Service for any reason, without notice, at any time, and without liability to you. You can deactivate your Arknewtech account by logging into the account you created. If we terminate your access to the Service or you use the service to deactivate your account, your photos, comments, likes, friendships, and all other data will no longer be accessible through your account (e.g., users will not be able to navigate to your username and view your photos), but those materials and data may persist and appear within the Service (e.g., if your Content has been re-shared by others).</li>
                        <li> Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use will immediately cease. </li>
                        <li> We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change these Terms from time to time. Unless we make a change for legal or administrative reasons, we will provide reasonable notice before the updated Terms become effective. You agree that we may notify you of the updated terms by posting them on the Service and that your use of the Service after the effective date of the updated terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the updated terms. Therefore, you should review these terms and any updated terms before using the Service. The updated terms will be effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the updated terms and will apply to your use of the Service from that point forward. These Terms will govern any disputes arising before the effective date of the updated terms.</li>
                        <li> We reserve the right to refuse access to the Service to anyone for any reason at any time.</li>
                        <li> We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username for any reason.</li>
                        <li> We may, but have no obligation to, remove, edit, block, and/or monitor Content or accounts containing Content that we determine in our sole discretion violates these terms.</li>
                        <li>You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or offline. You agree that Arknewtech is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. Arknewtech reserves the right but has no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment when interacting with others, including when you submit or post Content or any personal or other information.</li>
                        <li> There may be links from the Service, or from communications you receive from the Service to third-party websites or features. There may also be links to third-party websites or features in images or comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content that we do not control, maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service and a third-party website or feature, including applications that connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party website or feature. For example, the Service may include a feature that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which may be publicly posted on that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically requires you to login to your account on the third-party service and you do so at your own risk. Arknewtech does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their content. You expressly acknowledge and agree that Arknewtech is in no way responsible or liable for any such third-party services or features. YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD PARTY. You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk, to use applications that connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service (each, an "Application") and such Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your Service profile. By using such Applications, you acknowledge and agree to the following: </li>
                        <li> If you use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information about your profile on the Service being shared.</li>
                        <li> Your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if Arknewtech has not itself provided such information.</li>
                        <li> Your use of an Application is at your own option and risk, and you will hold Arknewtech (company/mobile application) harmless for activity related to the Application.</li>
                        <li> You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you incur through use of the Service. </li>
                        <li> We prohibit crawling, scraping, caching or otherwise accessing any content on the Service via automated means, including but not limited to, user profiles and photos (except as may be the result of standard search engine protocols or technologies used by a search engine with Arknewtech's express consent).</li>
